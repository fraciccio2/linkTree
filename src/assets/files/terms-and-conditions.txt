Linktree is a content sharing platform that enables creators to connect their audiences with their most recent and relevant content. One of our core values is to pursue deliberate simplicity — so we’ve tried to distill our terms and conditions into their simplest form here.<br>

<b>Welcome to Linktree!</b><br>
It’s great to have you here. By using Linktree, you agree to these Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) and the other policies that we link to here and on the Platform.<br>
These Terms (and the policies we link to) apply to your use of our website (https://linktr.ee/), apps and any other software or features provided in connection with our services (collectively the “Platform” or “Linktree”). When we say “we”, “our” or “us” in these Terms, we’re referring to Linktree Pty Ltd and our group companies.<br> 


Please read these Terms carefully and reach out if you have any questions. If you don’t agree with them, please don’t use Linktree.<br> 

<b<Your account</b><br>
To create an account and become a Linktree user, you must be at least 18. If you’re creating an account on behalf of someone else, you must have their permission to do so. You’re responsible for your account and using it in a lawful way.<br> 
When you create an account, you agree to comply with these Terms and that you’re (i) over 18, and (ii) legally able to enter these Terms with us. You must provide us with accurate info about yourself — if anything changes, please let us know so we can update your details.<br>


If you’re using Linktree on behalf of a business or individual, you agree that you’re authorised by them to act and agree to these Terms on their behalf.<br>


You’re responsible for anything that happens to your account, so keep your login details and password safe and don’t share them with anyone. If you think your account has been compromised, please contact us immediately.<br> 


You must not assign or transfer your account to someone else, or use your account (or allow it to be used by anyone) in a way which in our reasonable opinion, causes damage to Linktree or our reputation, or infringes another’s rights or applicable laws and regulations.<br>

<b>Your username</b><br>
The username you choose must be appropriate for everyone and cannot infringe someone else’s rights.<br>
We know the username you choose is very important to you. But it’s also important that your username is appropriate for all audiences and doesn’t infringe anyone’s rights, including intellectual property rights (such as copyright and trade marks) (“IP Rights”).<br> 

You can’t use the name of another person (such as a celebrity), brand or company, have a username that is offensive, vulgar or obscene, or create an account with a username that you have no connection with just to profit from it in the future (known as “Domain Squatting”).<br> 

If any of these issues occur over your username, we’ll consider the circumstances reasonably and may require you to change it (and we may reassign it to someone else). If you refuse, we may suspend or cancel your account. If someone claims that your username infringes their IP Rights, they’ll need to complete an Intellectual Property report and you’ll have the chance to then issue a Counter Notice.<br> 

If you’ve not signed in or added new links or had any traffic to your account in the last 6 months we may reclaim or reassign your username (but never without contacting you first).<br>

Your content — what is and isn’t allowed<br>
We love the variety of content that our users post on Linktree! However, we want to ensure that everyone who visits the Platform can do so safely. That’s why we have our Community Standards.<br>   
Our Community Standards set out what content is and isn’t allowed on Linktree, so please make sure you follow them, otherwise we may suspend or permanently remove your account.<br>
